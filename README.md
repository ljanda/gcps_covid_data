# GCPS Covid Data

This repo attempts to pull data from the [GCPS](http://publish.gwinnett.k12.ga.us/gcps/home/public/schools/content/return-to-learning-hub/covid19-info-by-school). 

In order to pull the data, I use the {tabulizer} package, but this is not always perfect, so it has required some more manual entry as well.
